The 70 people includes our staff, child care providers, parents and children. From 12pm-1230pm, we will be providing boxed lunches. The set up will be picnic style for folks to enjoy their lunch and our brief program. From 1230pm-1pm, we are still confirming but hope to secure a state legislator to briefly speak and encourage the crowd of advocates and supply them with advocacy talking points. From 1245pm-1pm, we will be walking from the west side lawn to the Swing Space for our advocacy meetings."
